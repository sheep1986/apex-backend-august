      transcript: `AI: Hello, may I speak with Sean please?

Customer: Yes, this is Sean speaking.

AI: Hi Sean! This is Sarah from Emerald Green Energy. I'm calling because we noticed you previously expressed interest in solar energy solutions. How are you doing today?

Customer: I'm doing well, thanks. Yes, I did look into solar a while back but never followed through.

AI: I understand completely. Many people are curious but want to make sure it's the right fit. What initially got you interested in solar energy?

Customer: Well, mainly the rising electricity costs. My bills have been getting pretty high, especially during summer with the AC running.

AI: That's a very common concern, and you're absolutely right to look for alternatives. On average, our customers see a 40-60% reduction in their energy costs, and some eliminate their bills entirely. Have you had a chance to look at your roof to see if it gets good sun exposure?

Customer: Yeah, we have a south-facing roof with no shade, so I think it would work well.

AI: That's perfect! South-facing roofs with no shade are ideal for solar panels. Based on what you're telling me, you could be an excellent candidate for solar. We're currently offering a special promotion where we can install a system with zero money down.

Customer: Zero down? How does that work exactly?

AI: Great question! We offer several financing options. With our most popular plan, you pay nothing upfront, and your monthly payment is typically less than what you're currently paying for electricity. So you start saving from day one.

Customer: That sounds interesting. What about maintenance and warranties?

AI: All our systems come with a 25-year warranty on the panels and a 10-year warranty on the inverters. As for maintenance, solar panels require very little - maybe an occasional cleaning, but rain usually takes care of that. We also provide 24/7 monitoring to ensure your system is always performing optimally.

Customer: What's the next step if I wanted to learn more?

AI: I'd love to schedule a free consultation where one of our solar advisors can visit your property, assess your roof, review your energy usage, and provide a custom quote showing exactly how much you could save. Would you prefer a morning or afternoon appointment?

Customer: Afternoons work better for me. Maybe sometime next week?

AI: Perfect! I have availability next Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. Which would work better for you?

Customer: Thursday afternoon would be great.

AI: Excellent! I'll schedule you for next Thursday at 2 PM. Our solar advisor will bring all the information you need and answer any questions. There's absolutely no obligation. Can I confirm your address?

Customer: Sure, it's 123 Main Street.

AI: Perfect, 123 Main Street. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details. Is there anything else you'd like to know before our visit?

Customer: No, I think that covers it for now. Thanks for calling!

AI: Thank you so much for your time, Sean! We look forward to showing you how solar can work for your home. Have a great rest of your day!

Customer: You too, goodbye!`
